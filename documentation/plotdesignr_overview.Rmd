`plotdesignr` is a package currently under development that provides a novel way to design and test the power of on-farm field experiments. Field research is time consuming, resource intensive, and can only be done once per year in many growing regions. Because of these constraints, it is important that every experiment is designed in a way that gives it the greatest chance of producing meaningful results.

#### Problem -
It is often speculated that the true effect size between treatments is small and large field experiments with a lot of spatial variablity result in "noisy" data. This combination creates a perfect storm for low-powered experiments.

#### Solution -
Using the example of the randomized complete block design (RCBD), yield clusters are created using historical yield data and blocks are placed inside of these homogenous zones. SEE XXX FOR CONCEPTUAL INTRODUCTION.

#### Current Functionality -

##### 1. Load multiple years yield data and prepare for clustering
The figure below represents three years of corn yield data for a field in 2014, 2016, and 2018. The point yield observations are aggregated into a common grid of hexagonal polygons to enable comparison across years.

```{r create-cluster-df, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
input_config <- read_yaml('./example_workflow_config.yml')
cluster_df <- make_cluster_data(config = input_config, plot = TRUE)
```

##### 2. Choose clustering parameters based on several critera
The three years of yield data are clustered using both the yield values and the distance between yield polygons with help from the [`ClustGeo`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03897.pdf) package. The combined weighting of yield similarity and geographic continuity allows for creating clusters large enough to fit a block of the experiment inside. 

```{r explore-mixing, eval=FALSE}
explore_best_mix(processed_data = cluster_df, cluster_number = 3, range = seq(0, 0.5, 0.1), plot = TRUE, output_path = input_config$output_path)
```
```{r explore-mixing-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./example_workflow_plots/mixing_parameter_map_3_clusters.png')
```

For this example, three clusters and a mixing parameter of 0.1 is selected (critera for choosing cluster number not shown).
```{r finalize-clusters}
# finalize cluster number and mixing parameter choice
clustered <- finalize_clusters(processed_data = cluster_df, cluster_number = 3, mixing_parameter = 0.1)
```

##### 3. Design new experiments 
One of the most powerful features of `plotdesignr` is the ability to interactively create and simulate various experimental designs. Once the clusters have been choosen, simply click on the map to design new experiments.

```{r load-experiments, echo=FALSE}
disconnected_01 <- readRDS('./saved_experiments/disconnected_01.rds')
disconnected_04 <- readRDS('./saved_experiments/disconnected_04.rds')
traditional_square <- readRDS('./saved_experiments/traditional_square.rds')
traditional_long <- readRDS('./saved_experiments/traditional_long.rds')
```

Experiments may either have disconnected blocks (shown here with three clusters and two different choices of "mixing parameter") or they may be "traditional" experiments with connected blocks in various arrangements.

```{r mix-plots, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Right: disconnected_01, three clusters with mixing parameter of 0.1. Left: disconnected_04, three clusters with mixing parameter of 0.4'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('./saved_experiments/disconnected_01.png', './saved_experiments/disconnected_04.png'))
```

```{r traditional-plots, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap='Right: traditional_square, traditional experiment with blocks in a 2x2 arrangement. Left: traditional_long, traditional experiment with blocks in a 4x1 arrangement.'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('./saved_experiments/traditional_square.png', './saved_experiments/traditional_long.png'))
```

##### 4. Test power of experimental designs   
The alternative designs are evaluated for statistical power at various effect sizes using the historical yield data and the [`simr`](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12504) package. The results below show that, on average, the design `disconnected_01` has greater statistical power for the same effect size while `disconnected_04` and `traditional_square` have the lowest power. This is made most clear in 2014 and 2018. **The interpretation is that for the same level of effect size between treatments, statistical tests are more likely to detect significant differences, when they are present, using the design `disconnected_01` compared to `traditional_square`.** 

```{r load-power-results, echo=FALSE}
power_df <- readRDS('./saved_experiments/power_df.rds')
# melt data from wide to long format
power_df_long <- data.table::melt(power_df, id.vars = 'source', variable.name = 'effect_size', value.name = 'power')
# remove 'X' from effect size names
power_df_long[, effect_size := gsub('X', '', effect_size)]

# caclulate average and 95% CI for each source and effect size
plot_df <- power_df_long[, .('power' = mean(power),
                             'upper' = quantile(power, 0.975),
                             'lower' = quantile(power, 0.025)), by = .(source, effect_size)]
# split source into its parts of experiment and file_id
plot_df[, c('experiment_id', 'file_id') := data.table::tstrsplit(source, "_(?!.*_)", perl = TRUE)]
```

```{r power-plots, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = effect_size, y = power, col = experiment_id, group = experiment_id)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0.8)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0.3), size = 2) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.3) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  facet_wrap(~ file_id, nrow = 2) +
  labs(subtitle = 'Average Power at Various Effect Sizes',
       y = 'Statistical Power',
       x = 'Effect Size') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2),
        panel.grid = element_blank())
```

#### Future work -

This demonstration highlights the influence of experimental design on statistical power in field experiments and provides a framework for identifying and testing potential designs. In order to make this work as impactful as possible, more research is needed to make recommendations for best practices in:

* How to choose cluster number
* How to choose mixing parameter
* Whether cluster data should only include the target crop
* Cleaning underlying input data
